# Task Description

Your task is to create a simple UI page that fetches and displays a list of 50 GitHub users using either a JavaScript framework of your choice or plain HTML and JavaScript. The page should allow the user to filter the displayed users by their usernames.



# GitHub API Integration:
- Utilize the GitHub API to fetch a list of 50 GitHub users.
- Display relevant user details such as username, avatar, and any other information you find interesting.

# User Filtering:
- Implement a filtering mechanism that allows the user to filter the displayed users based on their usernames.
- Provide an input field where the user can enter a username, and the displayed user list should dynamically update based on the input.

# User Interface:
- Design a clean and user-friendly interface to showcase the list of GitHub users and the filtering input.
- Display at least three details for each user (e.g., username, type, and avatar).

# Error Handling:
- Implement error handling for cases where the GitHub API request fails or no users are found.

# Technical Requirements:
- You can choose any JavaScript framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or opt for plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Ensure that the UI is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Make efficient use of the GitHub API to minimize unnecessary requests.

# Evaluation Criteria:
- Successful integration with the GitHub API to fetch user data.
- Implementation of a filtering mechanism for usernames.
- Quality of the user interface and overall design.
- Error handling for potential API request failures.
